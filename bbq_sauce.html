<h1>Fatty BBQ Sauce (Mayo-based)</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tsp Yellow Mustard</li>
    <li>2 tsp Dijon Mustard</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp hot sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Onion Powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Paprika</li>
    <li>Pinch Cayenne</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>Steak Seasoning (1 tbsp or so)</li>
    <li>Sugar Free BBQ Sauce (3 tbsp or so)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
Mix all ingredients MINUS the BBQ Sauce and Steak Seasoning.  It'll be a white-ish sauce, and taste almost like a savory BBQ sauce.  Add BBQ Sauce and Steak Seasoning to taste.  Generally 1 tbsp Steak Seasoning and 3 tbsp of BBQ sauce works for me.  It makes it taste like genuine BBQ sauce to me, though you might need to add more.

My BBQ sauce is G Hughes Sugar Free, which is 1 carb per tablespoon.  Since the goal is to make this as fatty as possible, I try to add a minimum amount of BBQ sauce, which is just empty carbs.
