# Benj's Cheesecake

## The Cake

Here's the base recipe I follow, minus the crust and plus fruity topping

Natasha says that the cheesecake is done when it "jiggles only slightly", which I've never managed to have an eye for.  In my opinion, it is far worse to undercook a cheesecake than to overcook it.  I undercooked the family cheesecake one Christmas, and it ruined everything.  It had the texture of brie.  Delicious, but weird.  My rule of thumb: bake it until the top is lightly browned.  Also, avoid opening the oven; try to view it through the window.  It's not quite overcooked at that point, but guaranteed to be done.  Far more reliable than Natasha's "jiggles only slightly" rule.

## Oreo Crust

I like to use Double-Stuft, since the ratio is perfect for auto-binding.  If using standard Oreos, some unsalted butter will be needed to bind.

1. Grind the hell out of it.  I like to use a ziploc bag and a rolling pin.  Usually this task is given to the peons (children also love this job).

2. Once ground, press into the bottom of the springform pan.  I love keeping the crust perfectly horizontal.  Some like to run it up the sides, but I like the organized straight crust.

## Strawberry / Generic Fruit Sauce

I use this sauce for pretty much every dessert.  It also works as pie and pastry filling.  I've done strawberry, blueberry, apple, kiwi, peach/plum, and mango.  All delicious.

### Ingredients:

* Fruit of any kind
* Sugar
* Cornstarch or flour (no more than 1 tbsp)

### Directions

1. Chop fruit into multiple sizes.  I like to have whole, sliced, and grated fruit so it has multiple textures throughout.

2. Boil fruit slowly in water that just about covers the fruit plus 1/2 inch or so, tasting and adding sugar several times.  You want the fruit to melt in your mouth.  Some like the fruit to still have a crunch to it, but I disagree.  Boil the shit out of it.

3. For apples, add cinnamon.  For strawberries or blueberries, squeeze some lime into it.  Best to do this when it's almost done, as the lime can get too zesty if it boils too long.

4. SLOWLY sift in a little cornstarch or flour near the end.  Too much at one time will cause doughy bits floating in it.  This will help thicken the sauce.  It should thicken a bit as it cools, but take a spoonful out and cool it to test if it thickens properly before removing the pot from heat.
